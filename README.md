# TrashMap implementation at rhok

### DESCRIPTION:

TrashMap, mapping Indias bins: This project aims at mapping all dustbins and waste management centres in the country. The team needs to build a smart application to crowd source the data and mark them on to an Open Street Map. The application needs to be smart in a way so that spammers can be avoided from entering fake data into the system. Also, meaningful analytics needs to be drawn from the collected open data to help take action & decision making for civic/government bodies.

### INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

1. Wastebin recognition: Step 1: install Anaconda
                         Step 2: create an anaconda environment
                         Step 3: install all tensorflow libraries
                         Step 4: launch a jupyter notebook
                         Step 5: upload the object_detection file
                         Step 6: run object_detection file
                      
2. Back End: Step 1: Create a remote server online using Heroku and deploy the application
             Step 2: Use Bottle framework for Python to create APIs for sending and receiving data
             Step 3: Use AWS S3 to store images of the dustbins and for classification of the images
             Step 4: Integrate back end with the front end 
 
3. Front End: 
   
   
   
   
### USAGE
   
The application will be used by the organisation and by users to track the dustbins and waste management centres in the city. The users will have access to report a missing dustbin or a dustbin that is not mapped onto the application. Neural Network classification is used to prevent spammers or junk data to be pushed onto the system.
