# TrashMap implementation at rhok

### DESCRIPTION:

TrashMap, mapping Indias bins: This project aims at mapping all dustbins and waste management centres in the country. The team needs to build a smart application to crowd source the data and mark them on to an Open Street Map. The application needs to be smart in a way so that spammers can be avoided from entering fake data into the system. Also, meaningful analytics needs to be drawn from the collected open data to help take action & decision making for civic/government bodies.

### INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

1. Wastebin recognition: 
                         
                         Step 1: install Anaconda

                         Step 2: create an anaconda environment
                         
                         Step 3: install all tensorflow libraries
                         
                         Step 4: launch a jupyter notebook
                         
                         Step 5: upload the object_detection file
                         
                         Step 6: run object_detection file
                      
2. Back End: 

             Step 1: Create a remote server online using Heroku and deploy the application

             Step 2: Use Bottle framework for Python to create APIs for sending and receiving data
             
             Step 3: Use AWS S3 to store images of the dustbins and for classification of the images
             
             Step 4: Integrate back end with the front end 
 
3. Front End: 

              Step 1:Install node.js

              Step 2:Install python IDE
              
              Step 3:Create a github account
              
              Step 4:Use an editor to create the HTML,JSON and Py files
              
              Step 5:Push all these files into Github
              
              Step 6:Extract all into Heroku App
              
              Step 7:In the Heroku app, click deployment and then click view.
              
              Step 8:If there are any changes to be made, we should use the following command:-
                     1)git add.
                     2)git commit -m 'nc'
                     3)git push origin master
                     
4. OpenStreetMap: 

                 Step 1: Install OpenLayers

                 ->we can create the map, using latitude and longitude of a particular area and add a marker to it. This marker                           represents the dustbin which the user uploads.
                 
                 ->we can report if the dustbin has any issues, and eventually leads to deletion after some form of verification.
                 
                 ->we can also find the nearest dustbin from a user's current location.
   
   
### USAGE
   
The application will be used by the organisation and by users to track the dustbins and waste management centres in the city. The users will have access to report a missing dustbin or a dustbin that is not mapped onto the application. Neural Network classification is used to prevent spammers or junk data to be pushed onto the system.
