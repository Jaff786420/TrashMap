## Back End
The application will be hosted on an EC2 server. Bottle framework for Python is going to be used to create APIs for adding new dustbin data, to delete dustbins, to modify dustbins and to view the dustbin data.
A deep learning model is going to be used to classify whether an input image is a dustbin or not. Data analysis will be performed on the available dataset to generate heatmaps and other sorts of graphs.
